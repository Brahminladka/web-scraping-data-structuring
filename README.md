# 🌎 **1. Earth911 Recycling Locator Scraper**

### ✅ Description
Automates the extraction of recycling center details from **Earth911.com**, including business names, addresses, accepted materials, and last update dates.

### ▶️ Usage Instructions
1. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install selenium beautifulsoup4 pandas
   ```
2. Ensure `msedgedriver.exe` is in the same directory.
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python earth911_final.py
   ```
4. Output is saved as **`recycling_locations.csv`**.

### 🔧 Configuration
Modify parameters in `main()` to customize scraping:
```python
results = scraper.scrape(
    material_type='Electronics',
    location='10001',
    max_distance=100,
    max_pages=5
)
```

# 🏬 **2. BestBuy Store Locator Scraper**

### ✅ Description
Scrapes store details from **BestBuy.com**, including name, address, phone, services, store hours, and more.

### ⚠️ Important Note
After Microsoft Edge opens, **you may need to manually refresh the website once** if it does not load properly during scraping.  
This ensures the elements are loaded correctly for Selenium to proceed.

### ▶️ Usage Instructions
1. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install selenium pandas
   ```
2. Keep `msedgedriver.exe` in the same folder as the script.
3. Run the scraper:
   ```bash
   python bestbuy.py
   ```
4. Scraped data will be saved as **`bestbuy_stores_with_details.csv`**.
